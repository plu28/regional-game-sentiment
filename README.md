1. What question are you trying to answer?
    - What steam games are the most favorite and most hated by region? 

2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
    - I think it would be interesting to analyze how cultural differences might effect preference in video games.

3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?
    - I expect popular games to remain popular but for certain genres to be more popular in certain regions. I know factory-games like Dyson Sphere Program or Factorio are very popular in Asian countries. Aside from that, I'm not sure what I'll find. 

4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
